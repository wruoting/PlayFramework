 * This template takes a single argument, a String containing a
 * message to display.

@(message: String)

@*
 * Call the `main` template with two arguments. The first
 * argument is a `String` with the title of the page, the second
 * argument is an `Html` object containing the body of the page.
 * The reason this is done is that the head of your html is going to be the "main" and the body will be the argument in it
